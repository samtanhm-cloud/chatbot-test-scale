## ✅ Is Real MCP Working?

### **Check These 3 Things:**

#### **1. Timing** ⏱️
```
MOCK (OLD):  29 commands in 3 seconds    ❌
REAL (NEW):  29 commands in 3-8 minutes  ✅
```

#### **2. Logs** 📋
```
MOCK:  [MCP Server] Assuming started (timeout) → commands finish fast
REAL:  [MCP Server] Connected successfully → commands take time
```

#### **3. Output** 📊
```json
MOCK:  {"output": "Executed browser_navigate successfully"}
REAL:  {"output": {"url": "...", "title": "...", "screenshot": "/tmp/..."}}
```
