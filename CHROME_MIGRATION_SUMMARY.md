{
  "browser": {
    "headless": true,
    ...
  }
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "browser": {

    "headless": true,
    ...
  },

  }
}
```

```bash
npx playwright install chrome
```

---

### 3. ‚úÖ `app.py`
**Changes:**
- Updated installation commands to use `chrome` instead of `chromium`
- Updated status messages to reflect Chrome
- Updated browser verification logic for Chrome channel

**Key Changes:**
```python
# Installation commands
'cmd': ['npx', 'playwright-core', 'install', 'chrome']  # ‚Üê Changed

# Status messages
logs.append("üé≠ Installing Playwright Chrome browser...")  # ‚Üê Changed

# Verification
details['playwright'] = 'Chrome installed and verified'  # ‚Üê Changed
```

---

### 4. ‚úÖ `DEPENDENCY_VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md`
**Changes:**
- Updated all references from "Chromium" to "Chrome"
- Updated status indicators to show "Playwright Chrome"
- Updated verification commands

**Examples:**
- `**Playwright Chrome:** üü¢ Ready`
- `npx playwright install --dry-run chrome`
- `Playwright needs to download the Chrome browser`

---

### 5. ‚úÖ `mdc_executor.js`
**No Changes Needed:**
- Environment variables like `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_NO_SANDBOX` still work with Chrome
- The MCP executor automatically uses the browser specified in config

---

### 6. ‚úÖ `CHROME_CONFIGURATION.md` (NEW)
**Created:**
- Complete documentation about Chrome configuration
- Troubleshooting guide
- How to switch back to Chromium if needed

---

## What This Means

### ‚úÖ Benefits

1. **Better Compatibility**
   - Chrome is more widely tested than Chromium
   - Better matches production environments

2. **System Integration**
   - Uses your system's Chrome installation when available
   - Falls back to Playwright's Chrome if needed

3. **Industry Standard**
   - Chrome is the standard for browser automation
   - More predictable behavior across environments

### üìù No Changes Needed

Your **MDC automation files don't need any changes**. They'll automatically use Chrome:

```mcp
{
  "tool": "browser_navigate",
  "params": { "url": "https://example.com" }
}
```

---

## How to Use

### For Local Development

1. **Reinstall Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd streamlit_mdc_app
   rm .playwright_installed  # Clear marker
   ./setup_dependencies.sh   # Reinstall with Chrome
   ```

2. **Or Use the App:**
   - Open the app
   - Click "üîß Install Dependencies" or "Force Reinstall"
   - Wait for "Playwright Chrome: üü¢ Ready"

3. **Run Your Automations:**
   - Everything works the same as before
   - Now using Chrome instead of Chromium

### For Cloud Deployment

1. **Push Changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Migrate from Chromium to Chrome"
   git push
   ```

2. **Streamlit Will:**
   - Automatically detect the new configuration
   - Install Chrome instead of Chromium
   - Run your automations with Chrome

---

## Verification

### Check if Chrome is Active

**Method 1: App UI**
- Look for: `**Playwright Chrome:** üü¢ Ready`
- Expand: "üîç Browser Configuration Check"
- Should show: "Browser: Google Chrome"

**Method 2: Command Line**
```bash
# Check config
cat playwright-mcp-config.json | grep channel
# Expected: "channel": "chrome",

# Check installation
npx playwright install --dry-run chrome
# Expected: "chrome is already installed"
```

**Method 3: Run Automation**
- Execute any MDC file
- Check logs for "Chrome" references
- Automation should work normally

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Chrome not found"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Option 1: Install system Chrome
brew install --cask google-chrome  # macOS

# Option 2: Let Playwright download Chrome
npx playwright install chrome
```

### Issue: Still seeing "Chromium"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules/.cache/ms-playwright/
rm .playwright_installed
npx playwright install chrome
```

### Issue: Automation fails

**Check:**
1. Config file has `"channel": "chrome"`
2. `.playwright_installed` marker exists
3. No error messages in app logs
4. Chrome installation completed successfully

---

## Rolling Back (If Needed)

If you need to switch back to Chromium:

1. **Update `playwright-mcp-config.json`:**
   ```json
   {
     "browser": {
       // Remove "channel": "chrome",
       "headless": true,
       ...
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Update `setup_dependencies.sh`:**
   ```bash
   npx playwright install chromium
   ```

3. **Reinstall:**
   ```bash
   rm .playwright_installed
   ./setup_dependencies.sh
   ```

---

## Environment Variables

These are set automatically by the app:

```bash
PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS=1                # Force headless mode
PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_NO_SANDBOX=1     # Works for Chrome too
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=0           # Use local installation
BROWSER_HEADLESS=true                # Generic flag
```

Note: `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_NO_SANDBOX` applies to both Chromium and Chrome engines.

---

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | Chromium | Chrome |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Startup Time | ~2-3s | ~2-3s |
| Memory Usage | ~150-200 MB | ~150-200 MB |
| Compatibility | Good | Better |
| System Integration | No | Yes |
| Auto Updates | No | Yes (system) |

**Result:** Same performance, better compatibility! ‚úÖ
