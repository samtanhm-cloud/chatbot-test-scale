# 🔧 NPM Install Fix - Critical Update

## 🚨 Problem Found in Logs

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Log File:** `logs-samtanhm-cloud-chatbot-test-scale-main-app.py-2025-10-29T08_52_47.538Z.txt`

### **What Was Wrong:**

✅ Node.js installed successfully (v18.20.4)  
✅ npm installed successfully (v9.2.0)  
✅ Python packages installed successfully  
❌ **`npm install` NEVER RAN** - npm packages from `package.json` were NOT installed

**Result:** MCP SDK not available → Automation uses mock mode → Fast but fake results

---

## 📋 Evidence from Logs

**Searched for:**
- `npm install` → ❌ Not found
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` → ❌ Not found
- `@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server` → ❌ Not found
- `package.json processed` → ❌ Not found

**What the logs showed:**
```
Line 2832: Setting up npm (9.2.0~ds1-1)  ✅ npm installed
Line 2916: Python dependencies were installed  ✅ Python OK
Line 2922: End of logs  ❌ No npm install!
```

---

## 🔧 The Fix

**Root Cause:** Streamlit Cloud does NOT automatically run `npm install`

**Solution:** Add command to run `npm install` after deployment

---

## ✅ Fix Applied: Option 1 (Recommended)

### **Updated File: `.streamlit/config.toml`**

Added this section:
```toml
[runner]
# Install npm packages before app starts
postStartCommand = "cd /mount/src/chatbot-test-scale && npm install"
```

**How it works:**
1. Streamlit Cloud deploys your app
2. Runs the `postStartCommand` automatically
3. npm install executes → installs MCP SDK
4. App starts with real MCP packages available

---

## 🚀 How to Deploy the Fix

### **Step 1: Commit the Updated config.toml**

```bash
cd "/Users/tansa/Desktop/Playwright mcp rule file/streamlit_mdc_app"

# Add the updated config file
git add .streamlit/config.toml

# Also add the new setup script (optional backup)
git add setup_npm.sh
git add NPM_INSTALL_FIX.md

# Commit
git commit -m "Fix: Add postStartCommand to run npm install on Streamlit Cloud

- Updated .streamlit/config.toml with runner.postStartCommand
- This ensures npm packages (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk) are installed
- Fixes issue where MCP SDK was missing despite package.json being present
- Add setup_npm.sh as alternative installation method"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### **Step 2: Redeploy on Streamlit Cloud**

1. Go to: https://share.streamlit.io/
2. Find: `chatbot-test-scale`
3. Click: **⋮ → Reboot app**
4. Wait: 5-10 minutes

### **Step 3: Verify npm install Runs**

**In the new deployment logs, you should see:**
```
[runner] Running postStartCommand...
[runner] cd /mount/src/chatbot-test-scale && npm install

npm install
added 150 packages in 45s

@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@0.5.0
@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server@latest
```

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Fixed

### **Check 1: Deployment Logs**

Look for:
```
✅ npm install
✅ added XXX packages
✅ @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
✅ @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server
```

### **Check 2: Runtime Logs (When You Run Automation)**

Look for:
```
✅ [MCP Server] Starting: npx -y @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server
✅ [MCP Server] Connected successfully
✅ [MCP Server] Available tools: 15
✅ [Command Executor] Completed in 2347ms (not 100ms!)
```

### **Check 3: Timing**

```
OLD (Mock):  29 commands in 3 seconds    ❌
NEW (Real):  29 commands in 3-8 minutes  ✅
```

---

## 📊 Before vs After

### **BEFORE (Current State from Logs):**

| **Aspect** | **Status** |
|------------|------------|
| Node.js | ✅ Installed |
| npm | ✅ Installed |
| npm install ran? | ❌ NO |
| MCP SDK available? | ❌ NO |
| Automation mode | ❌ Mock (fake results) |
| Execution time | ❌ 3 seconds (too fast) |

### **AFTER (With Fix):**

| **Aspect** | **Status** |
|------------|------------|
| Node.js | ✅ Installed |
| npm | ✅ Installed |
| npm install ran? | ✅ YES (via postStartCommand) |
| MCP SDK available? | ✅ YES |
| Automation mode | ✅ Real (actual browser) |
| Execution time | ✅ 3-8 minutes (realistic) |

---

## 🎯 Alternative Solutions (If Option 1 Doesn't Work)

### **Option 2: Use setup_npm.sh Script**

Update `.streamlit/config.toml`:
```toml
[runner]
postStartCommand = "bash /mount/src/chatbot-test-scale/setup_npm.sh"
```

### **Option 3: Install in app.py (Runtime)**

Add to `app.py` at startup:
```python
import subprocess
import os

# Check if node_modules exists
if not os.path.exists('node_modules/@modelcontextprotocol'):
    subprocess.run(['npm', 'install'], check=True)
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **If npm install Still Doesn't Run:**

1. **Check config.toml syntax:**
   - Make sure no typos
   - Correct path: `/mount/src/chatbot-test-scale`

2. **Check Streamlit Cloud supports postStartCommand:**
   - Feature might not be available on all plans
   - Alternative: use app.py runtime install (Option 3)

3. **Check for errors in logs:**
   - Search for "postStartCommand"
   - Look for npm errors

### **If MCP SDK Still Not Found:**

Check these:
1. `package.json` exists in repo root ✅
2. `package.json` has correct syntax ✅
3. npm registry accessible from Streamlit Cloud ✅
4. Package name correct: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` ✅

---

## 📞 Next Steps

1. ✅ **Commit updated config.toml** (command above)
2. ✅ **Push to GitHub**
3. ✅ **Redeploy on Streamlit Cloud**
4. ✅ **Check new deployment logs** for npm install
5. ✅ **Test automation** - should take 30+ seconds
6. ✅ **Verify real MCP** in runtime logs

---

## 🎉 Expected Result After Fix

When you run an automation after this fix:

```
[MCP Executor] Starting execution...
[MCP Executor] Parsed 29 commands
[MCP Server] Starting: npx -y @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server
[MCP Server] Connected successfully ✅
[MCP Server] Available tools: 15
[MCP Server]   - browser_navigate
[MCP Server]   - browser_click
[MCP Server]   - browser_snapshot
...
[Command Executor] Tool: browser_navigate
[Command Executor] Completed in 2347ms ✅ (Real timing!)
...
Total execution: 3-8 minutes ✅ (Real browser automation!)
```

**No more 100ms fake responses!** 🚀

---

## ✅ Summary

**Problem:** npm install never ran → MCP SDK missing → Mock mode  
**Fix:** Add `postStartCommand` to `.streamlit/config.toml`  
**Result:** Real MCP SDK → Real browser automation  
**Action:** Commit config.toml + Push + Redeploy  

**This fix is critical for real browser automation to work!** 🎯
