# 🔄 Force Streamlit Cloud to Use New Code

## The Issue

Your fix is **already pushed to GitHub** ✅, but Streamlit Cloud is still running the **old cached code**. You need to manually force a redeployment.

---

## Solution: Force Reboot App

### Option 1: Reboot from Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to: **https://share.streamlit.io/**
2. Find your app: **chatbot-test-scale**
3. Click the **⋮ (three dots menu)** on the right
4. Select **"Reboot app"**
5. Wait 1-2 minutes for fresh deployment

This will clear the cache and use the latest code from GitHub.

---

### Option 2: Delete and Redeploy App

If reboot doesn't work:

1. Go to: **https://share.streamlit.io/**
2. Find your app: **chatbot-test-scale**
3. Click **⋮ menu → Delete app**
4. Click **"New app"** to create fresh deployment:
   - Repository: `samtanhm-cloud/chatbot-test-scale`
   - Branch: `main`
   - Main file: `app.py`
5. Add secrets again (copy from old app settings before deleting)

---

### Option 3: Clear Cache + Redeploy

1. In your Streamlit app dashboard
2. Click **⋮ menu → Settings**
3. Click **"Clear cache"**
4. Then click **"Reboot app"**

---

## What to Look For After Reboot

### ✅ Success Indicators:

The logs should show:
```
[timestamp] 📦 Processed dependencies!
[timestamp] 🚀 App started successfully
```

**NO more of these old messages:**
```
❌ 🔍 Setting up virtual display for browser automation...
❌ ⚠️  MCP SDK not found, installing npm packages...
❌ ⚠️  Installing Playwright browsers (chromium)...
```

### App Should:
- ✅ Load in < 30 seconds
- ✅ Show UI with sidebar
- ✅ Display "🟢 AI Connected"
- ✅ Show dependency status section
- ✅ Display "🔧 Install Dependencies" button

---

## If Still Having Issues

### Verify Deployment Settings:

1. In Streamlit Cloud dashboard → App settings
2. Confirm:
   - **Main file path**: `app.py` (NOT `streamlit_mdc_app/app.py`)
   - **Branch**: `main`
   - **Python version**: 3.9+ (automatically detected)

### Check the File Path

If your GitHub repo structure is:
```
chatbot-test-scale/
  └── app.py              ← Should point HERE
```

Then main file should be: `app.py`

If structure is:
```
chatbot-test-scale/
  └── streamlit_mdc_app/
      └── app.py          ← Should point HERE
```

Then main file should be: `streamlit_mdc_app/app.py`

---

## Alternative: Force Push (Last Resort)

If none of the above works, force GitHub to trigger a webhook:

```bash
cd "/Users/tansa/Desktop/Playwright mcp rule file/streamlit_mdc_app"

# Make a small change to force redeploy
echo "" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Trigger redeployment"
git push origin main
```

Then wait 2-3 minutes for auto-redeploy.

---

## Summary

**Your code is correct and pushed** ✅  
**Streamlit Cloud just needs to pick up the new code** 🔄

**Fastest solution**: Go to dashboard → Reboot app

---

After rebooting, you should see the app load successfully in <30 seconds! 🎉
